optimizations:
- static quantization
- torch.compile
    - torchscript
- pca
- tsne

metrics
- accuracy
- precision
- recall
- f1 score
- memory consumption
- recall against memory consumption
- accuracy against memory consumption
- recall against parameter count

raspberry pi
- get same metrics measured on pc
- temperature
- power consumption

extensions: 
- use camera
- gui application
- make own dataset

docker

stuff to ask:
- what's expected in the report?
- appendix?
- github?

- make calc_test6
- collect metrics and plot everything
- make individual calc programs for each type of optimization
- make it save the results to a txt file?
- upload files to pi
- test each one
- try out other optimizations
    - pruning
    - knowledge distilation

things to ask oliver:
- camera step-by-step how to deploy
- my code: precision accuracy
- use different programming language? c so it runs quicker and can free up memory
